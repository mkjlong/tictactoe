# Tic Tac Toe


## Features


#### MinMax Bot

By setting the mode to singleplayer, you will be able to face a bot, with a min-max algorithm to determine the best move in every situation.

You can also see the best move by typing the `board.bestMove()` command on the console. (press f12, then go to the console tab).

#### LocalStorage

Using the `localStorage` feature, you can reload the website and still continue playing, without the board or any of your setting resetting.

#### Scoring system

You can see how many times you've won, drawed or lost against the other player, to the right side of the board.
